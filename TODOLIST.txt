build out notifications model:

NOTIFY...
a driver when their trip is filled
a driver when someone joins their trip
a driver when someone cancels
a driver when they cancel

a rider when they've joined a trip
a rider when they've left a trip
a rider when a driver cancels his trip
a rider when a driver updates his trip


fire off view actions in the ridestore
on request completion
on request delete
on ride delete


create two notifications at one
but stores should only include currentUser's notifications


dedicate div to notifications / errors

restyle the viewport, create views for individual rides
stop table from reordering when you update a ride
change color of error notifications
